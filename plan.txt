# A node such as a desktop or laptop should represent a single cluster
At the start, only two nodes (say laptops) are part of the network. You start
node 1 and join node 2 to the network.
A third node (and subsequent nodes) should be able to join and/or leave the
network
        o If a node leaves the network, the resources that it holds should be
        relocated to another node.
        o If a node rejoins the network, its previous resources should be re-
        allocated to it
        o You may develop a simple algorithm to effect the above operations (for
        example, the resources could be relocated to the closest node. The
        distance can be measured by the RTTs between the nodes)
• A client application should be able to search (query) one of the live nodes for a
specific item hosted. The query should be routed appropriately to the node
that has the resource. The response should indicate which node provided the
response.
• You may need to build a simple LAN to mimic an overlay network for the P2P
system








3. Additional Information
• You can make extensive use of sockets and write out your code in your
preferred programming language (If you can do Python, great but not a
requirement)
• The resource to be shared are simple text files (It should be possible for a
single resource to be available on two nodes)
